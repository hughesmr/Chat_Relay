The program has been written in python so to compile all you need to do is to open you terminal and type "python /path/to/file/chatServer.py" for the server and "python /path/to/file/chatClient.py". That will run the both of them. There will only be one server running so you won't be able to connect multiple servers. 

THE SERVER:

When the server begins it asks for a password. The password is used to close the server from the client. The server will run now without any input.

THE CLIENT:

Services:
List peers
List rooms
Create room
Join Room


The first thing the client asks for is the ip or host name of the computer you are connecting to. I found that when using the lab machines it was easier to just use the host name. You will now be asked to enter a user name, once the user name is entered a menu appears. The menu will guide you through how to use to program. However if join room or create room are selected you will need to enter the name of the room. To quit just enter the "q" command, to terminate the server enter command mode by typing "cmd" and then you will need to enter the password that was entered when the server was started. If other Clients are connected to the server will server will not end until they disconnect.
